- Setup reproducible repo
- Setup github.io
- Setup ToC in Keynote

	why rec sys -- use eric's example
	why deep learning
		-- not because of huge data -- but for flexibility
		- Lot's of relationships like s7 in:
			https://www.slideshare.net/xamat/recsys-2016-tutorial-lessons-learned-from-building-reallife-recommender-systems
		recs in industry slide s6
			https://www.slideshare.net/xamat/past-present-and-future-of-recommender-systems-and-industry-perspective
		lesson learned:
			- data density is ext. important
			- data heterogeneity is impo
			- explanations matter (show feeding to many teams)
			- reusable, transformable, interp, reliable: s33

Goals
	- install, download & setup data
	- train a rec immediately -- in a notebook
	- eval it
	- viz / interpret it
	- deploy it
	- improve it

2. MF Follow Along
	- Kick off model immediately, then explain what's happening

	- Goal at end: to be training your own model

	- visualize matrix
	- objective functions
	- like w2v
	- reguliarization
	- train in ignite
	- viz in tensorbordx
	- metrics: AUC & cAUC


3. Interpretation of vectors Follow Along
	- Goal: to understand the outputs of your model

	- Why: humans have some ideas of whats important
	- we don't care about scores: care about interp
	- PCA basics
	- Interpretation basics
	- "personalizability" / polarizaibility
	- Gumbel-softmax?
	- t-SNE diagrams


4. Infrastructure (no follow-along)
	- No concrete action: just an example infra
	- Intra-day featurization
	- model training can mostly fit in one machine
	- evalutaion:
		- don't train on your data
		- A/B testing w/ data mixing across cells
		- AUC vs cAUC


4. Features in MF
	- Cold-start
	- Temporal features
	- Multi-output models
	

- MF
	Simple embedding
	loss: rms

- MF: bias + embedding

PAUSE FOR INTERPRETATION

- W2V with same model :) [TODO]

- MF with side-features

- MF with temporal features

- FM

- Mixture of Tastes

- Deep MF

- VMF


- Interpretation w/ Procrustes [TODO]

- Gumbel-softmax [TODO]


- LSTM explicit sequence learning [TODO]

9. Add temporal features
10. Add side features

7. Other approaches
	- SVD
	- mention this approach
	- spotlight
	- BPR
	- ALS
	- SVD ++
	- Tensor Fact
	- FMs

	- Hashed embeddings

8. Other considerations
	- efficientcy
	-realtime
	- diversity
	- explanatory
	- portfolio optimization

2. NLP + w2v -- MAYBE
